Caution 

 - Depends on the battery, its power changes a lot. So you should regulate the time of'turn delay' on code.

 - Line at the corner should be curved. If it is a right angle, it could not sense the line and just pass it.

 - Click one button at once.

 - Bluetooth connection should be done before 'line sensing'. If connect after 'line sensing', 'Librarian Helper' does not work accurately.
